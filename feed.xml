                    Furball Plaza is the central hub of the game, where cats can gather, socialize, and access shops and various activities. Key locations include the Catnip Caf√©, Catwalk Boutique, and Art Studio. This is the main area/location of the game! Probably the busiest and most active.

<p><strong>Moonlit Meadow</strong> is a serene and grassy area that comes alive under the glow of the moon where shooting stars can often be seen. Cats can take a walk in the meadow, play games, stargaze and unwind. At the center of the meadow, cats can find a campfire and sit around it to tell nighttime stories.</p>

<p>What do you think? It's my personal favorite. :)</p>

<p>They participated in the survey I made to know more about player preferences and other stuff, and they have been super great and wholesome. A big thank you to the moderators for letting me share the project and blog too! :)</p>
<p>I finished setting up the <a href="https://discord.gg/x5csasTw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>, it doesn't have a logo yet but I will work on that ASAP, join it!</p>
<p>I will probably share some little <em>secret </em>stuff like some locations/WIP designs etc...</p>
<p>Until then, see you later! üêà</p>
