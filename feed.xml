</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="cBGGJ OIC90c" dir="auto">I'd be extremely grateful if you could answer the survey, I believe the insights gathered from it would not only help me immensely in developing Furball City, but it might also stir up some great nostalgic memories :D</div>
</blockquote>
<div dir="auto">¬†</div>
<div dir="auto">This is what I said when <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClubPenguin/comments/13l96bl/club_penguin_survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sharing a survey</a> I made to know what aspects of CP <em>(Club Penguin)</em> were successful and which ones fell short!</div>
<div dir="auto">The survey did very well and got 44 very interesting answers, I really loved reading those, and still have a few left to read.</div>
<div dir="auto">The answers are surprisingly pretty varied but some of them were actually recurring ones.</div>
<div dir="auto">¬†</div>
<div dir="auto">Interestingly, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClubPenguin/comments/13wz4pk/club_penguin_survey_on_gameplay_survey_results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gameplay Survey</a> with different questions was recently posted on the r/ClubPenguin subreddit. It offered a fresh perspective that I found very insightful!</div>
<div dir="auto">¬†</div>
<div dir="auto">Anyways.</div>
<div dir="auto"><hr></div>
<h1 dir="auto"><em>So what's next for Furball City?</em></h1>
<div dir="auto">Well, I've been working on and off on concept and ideas that I gathered into a single place.</div>

<figcaption>"Nonsense ideas"</figcaption>
</figure>
</div></div>
<p>I primarily use Discord to gather and organize all my ideas! I know it's kinda unusual, lol</p>
<p>Normal ideas are ideas that I think could be neat to have in the game, or QOL features.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> <em>"Text at the bottom of the screen that appears for a few seconds when you enter a different area (eg. enters the caf√© -&gt; "Catnip Caf√©")"</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><em>"Logging in daily gives you coins"</em></p>
<p>¬†</p>
<p>Whereas nonsense ideas... <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">They speak for themselves.</span></p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong>¬†<em>"Event where literally <strong>everyone </strong>is in a pizza, donut, whatever costume"</em></p>
<p>(I'm still wondering how and why I got this idea...)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p><em>"Banned players have a short animation "on-ban" where they get kidnapped by an eagle (bye bye üëã)"</em></p>
<p>(Let's just not speak about that one.)</p>
<p>I could add them into special events, for April Fools day, or possibly never‚Äîit's part of the fun!</p>
<hr>
<h1>Sneak Peek</h1>
<p>I use Milanote for more "final" concepts, it's very nice for everything related to the project, I can edit it anytime, add reference videos, images, drawings, text, arrow, etc...</p>
<p>Here's a sneak peek of the main location, <strong><a href="https://kuramadscientist.github.io/StarlightFoxBlog/location-furball-plaza/">Furball Plaza</a></strong>:</p>

                    Furball Plaza is the central hub of the game, where cats can gather, socialize, and access shops and various activities. Key locations include the Catnip Caf√©, Catwalk Boutique, and Art Studio. This is the main area/location of the game! Probably the busiest and most active.

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Moonlit Meadow</strong> is a serene and grassy area that comes alive under the glow of the moon where shooting stars can often be seen. Cats can take a walk in the meadow, play games, stargaze and unwind. At the center of the meadow, cats can find a campfire and sit around it to tell nighttime stories.</p>

<p>What do you think? It's my personal favorite. :)</p>

<p>I finished setting up the <a href="https://discord.gg/x5csasTw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord server</a>, it doesn't have a logo yet but I will work on that ASAP, join it!</p>
<p>I will probably share some little <em>secret </em>stuff like some locations/WIP designs etc...</p>
